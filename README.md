# shopify-theme-vue

Vue to Shopify Liquid - A powerful development tool that integrates Vue.js into Shopify's Liquid template system with server-side rendering and optimal performance.

### Features
- 🧪 Modern Stack: Built with Vue 3, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vite — providing a clean, maintainable, and future-proof development experience.

- 🔥 Server-side Rendering: Renders Vue 3 components into Shopify Liquid templates for better SEO and first paint performance.

- 🛍️ Seamless Shopify Integration: Works with both new and legacy Shopify themes — no migration required.

- 🧩 Built-in Component Library: Comes with a customizable component library designed for quick adaptation to your project needs.

### Roadmap
- ♿ Semantic and Accessible Component Integration
Reference or integrate community-driven component libraries to provide a collection of reusable UI and business components that follow semantic HTML and web accessibility (a11y) best practices.

- 🔄 Vite Dev Integration for Shopify Theme Development
Improve consistency between development and production environments by integrating Shopify theme development mode with Vite's dev server.

- 🔗 Passing Shopify Theme Data and Views into Vue Templates
Enable passing store data, editor config, and existing Liquid views (like snippets or sections) into Vue components — inspired by [Shopify Web Components](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/storefront-web-components), using special wrapper components to expose external content to Vue.
